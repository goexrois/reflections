What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initially the repository is empty because git is considerated enough to let you decide which files 
of your new repository do yo want to include into the versioning system. So you need to add 
files to the repository in order to git start tracking changes on the files you're interested in 
doing so.
